## Try Tiktok Again by NextJS

#### Initiate the project by NextJS

1. Config the project by Next.js, and add husky to pre-commit to GitHub.
2. Create the sanity back platform by running following `yarn add @sanity/cli` and
   `npx sanity init --coupon javascriptmastery2022`, to initiate the sanity project in platform, and create the directory of 'sanity-first-server'.
3. Inside the 'sanity-first-server', I created some schemas similar as 'mongoose' lib.
4. Run `sanity start` to create the sanity studio to preview the cms locally, we also can find the same project in sanity.io, here notice that postedBy is invalid because of its 'reference' type.
5.
